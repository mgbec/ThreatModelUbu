# Architectural Diagram Threat Analyzer - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Architectural Diagram Threat Analyzer is a Python-based tool that can ingest architectural diagrams and produce threat modeling and risk assessment information. It uses computer vision techniques to extract components and their relationships from diagrams, and then applies threat modeling methodologies to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Key Components

1. **Diagram Parser**: Extracts components and connections from architectural diagrams in various formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, draw.io, Visio).
   - Uses OpenCV for image processing
   - Identifies components and their relationships
   - Converts diagrams into a standardized internal representation

2. **Threat Analyzer**: Analyzes the architecture for potential security threats using the STRIDE methodology.
   - Applies threat rules to components, connections, and the overall architecture
   - Evaluates risk levels based on impact and likelihood
   - Provides mitigation recommendations

3. **Report Generator**: Generates comprehensive threat modeling and risk assessment reports in various formats.
   - Supports PDF, HTML, Markdown, and JSON formats
   - Includes executive summaries, detailed threat information, and mitigation recommendations
   - Customizable templates and styling

4. **Utility Modules**: Provides supporting functionality for the main components.
   - Configuration management
   - Custom exceptions
   - Data models for architecture and threats

## Features

- **Automated Threat Modeling**: Automatically identifies potential security threats in architectural diagrams
- **Multi-Format Support**: Works with various diagram formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, draw.io, Visio)
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates detailed reports with threat information and mitigation recommendations
- **Customizable**: Configurable threat rules, risk assessment parameters, and report templates
- **Well-Documented**: Includes comprehensive documentation and unit tests
- **Extensible**: Easy to extend with new diagram formats, threat rules, and report formats

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze a single diagram
arch-threat-analyzer -i path/to/diagram.png -o path/to/output/directory

# Analyze multiple diagrams in a directory
arch-threat-analyzer -i path/to/diagrams/directory -o path/to/output/directory

# Specify output format
arch-threat-analyzer -i path/to/diagram.png -o path/to/output/directory -f pdf
```

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Component Recognition**: Enhance the computer vision algorithms to better recognize components in diagrams
2. **Add More Threat Rules**: Expand the threat rule database with additional security threats and vulnerabilities
3. **Support More Diagram Formats**: Add support for additional diagram formats and tools
4. **Enhance Report Templates**: Create more detailed and customizable report templates
5. **Add Machine Learning**: Incorporate machine learning for better component recognition and threat identification
